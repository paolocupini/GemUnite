# GemUnite

GemUnite is an application that allows IT enthusiasts to search for or create small to medium-sized groups to undertake projects within their areas of interest.

Upon creating an account, users, in addition to providing personal information, input their areas of interest, such as machine learning, web development, cybersecurity, IoT, etc. The homepage displays project proposals within the user's areas of interest, showcasing current members for each proposal along with information about the project creator. Users can also access details about the proposed project and send a participation request to join the group.

A registered user can create a project proposal by providing information about the scope, a description of the project idea, the group size, and, once published, can accept or reject participation requests.

In the project section, users can view the projects they are participating in (along with relevant information) and access each project's dedicated page. Within the project page, members can track progress through checkpoints set by the leader, add internal tasks to checkpoints, and mark tasks as completed. Users have the ability to edit project information and remove members if they are the group creator. Project members can utilize a chat feature and access the project repository created through the GitHub API.
